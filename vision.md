## Vision

Conferences give an oppotunity to hear about other people's experiences with interests that we share.
The problem starts when we want to talk about it with others but struggle to find people to talk with.
We might go around asking if people are interested in discussing the subject but, after an unlucky streak, our time might end up wasted.
Our product's vision is to help and promote this type of informal discussion by providing a platform where people with similar interests can find each other more easily through discussion groups and event planning.
