1.  `screens` — Contains the screens of your application. All files from here get imported into  `routes.dart`
2.  `util` — Contains the utilities/common functions of your application
3.  `widgets` — Contains the common widgets for your applications. For example,  `Button` ,  `TextField`  etc.
4.  `routes.dart` — Contains the routes of your application and imports all screens.
5. `data` — This folder would come into the picture once you integrate redux(or other) store into the application. Here you would put your reducers, actions etc.
6. `services` — This would handle all network and business logic of your application. For example, once you are authenticated with facebook/google you need to update backend with access tokens you can place that authentication in this folder.
